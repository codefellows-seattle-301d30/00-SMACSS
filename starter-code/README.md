##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Selectors targeting elements fundamental to the entire document were put in the base.css file; rules targeting header, footer, and general layout of different parts of the page go in the layout.css file. All rules targetting smaller sub elements go in the modules.css file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not change any of the actual css code. I probably could have organized it a bit better but it prefectly replicates the original style.css code.
