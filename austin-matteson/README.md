##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Base is the highlest level, so each change is very vague and far-reaching. Next is layout, which hits various larger sections. Then finally, modules, for the individual and specific changes.)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(None was needed. Everything worked exactly as expected and the site remained as originally constructed during the move from one file to three.)
