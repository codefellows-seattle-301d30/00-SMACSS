##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I went off the suggestions in the readme and used my best judgement.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring. I wasn't sure what would be optimal so I decided to leave it alone figuring we'll go over it in class.
