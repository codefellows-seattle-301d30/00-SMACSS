##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

When starting from the brodest, it was easy to just put a couple things in the base.css that would effect most of the document. I chose just to put the background color, and font-family in this document because it applied to the whole page. Deciding what should go in layout.css vs. modules.css was a little more difficult. I kept moving things back and forth. For the layout I tried to keep within the definition and just use it for big sections/area styling and then thru all the more specific stuff into the modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't do any refactoring, only because while this might have a lot of ids and classes, it still seemed pretty clean and orgninized, and when I went to refactor it it just got a little messy and more confusing. I feel that the way it is set up is an easy way for people to understand what is going on and make it easier for them to make changes.
