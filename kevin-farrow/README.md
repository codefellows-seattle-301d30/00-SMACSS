##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I fallowed the SMACSS guidelines? I tried to pick out what rules would be applied to multiple pages and what seemed to be more page spesific. Then narrowed those down by what level they controlled.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not. I focused on what each rule was address rather than attempting to rewrite them.
