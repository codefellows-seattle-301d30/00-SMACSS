##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

By reading over all the code files and figuring out their respective roles in the webpage. The more specific something the was, the easier it was to determine which file should go where.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I wouldn't necessarily say I refactored any of the code. However, there was an image.gif file that had no corresponding file and was not showing (or affecting) anything on the page. So I removed it. It was in the hr {...} css selector.
