##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Looked at the overall rule and determined how broad or how specific it was and followed the guide as to what each css file should contain.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring. Primarily because CSS is still something I dont fully understand.
