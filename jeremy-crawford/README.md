##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I thought about which "level" of my code it would be. for instance, base elements are level 1, and contains any element that can be built upon. Layout lements are level 2, and sit directly on the base. modules is level 3, nd includes anything that sits inside of layout or causes specific class or ID changes to elements in layout.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, didn't feel like it was pertinent at this time.
