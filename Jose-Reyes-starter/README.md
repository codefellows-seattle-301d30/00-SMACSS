##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Intructions on how to do this are very fluid. I found this can be left to interpretation. I tried to left the "main body (body, main)" in the base file. Moved code that modified small items like lists to module and the rest was moved to layout.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No
