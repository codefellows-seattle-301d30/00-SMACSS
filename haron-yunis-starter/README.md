##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I placed anything the effects the entire body in the base.css

I then placed anything that effects general position like the nav in layouts as well as all my ID's and Classes.

Lastly I put all specific elements and Id's and classes with child decendents in the module.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.
NO. It works fine already.
