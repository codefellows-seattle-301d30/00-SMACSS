##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

The base was populated with body and * styles.

The modules were anything that was a class (resulting in a .<className>). 

The layout was any element or id (resulting in a #<idName>).

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No. Didn't need to. It went rather willingly.
