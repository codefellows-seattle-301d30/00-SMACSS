##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I use my best guess by placing css elements that apply to body and main into base.css, anything that has to do with the overall layout to layout.css, and lastly the remaining specific css elements into modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.
No. I didn't not use any refactoring. All classes and ids can stay the same way as they are right now because they are applied to html tags.
